# Security Write-ups & Tools 🛡️

This repository contains my security research, vulnerability write-ups,
and proof-of-concepts (PoCs) created as part of my learning in cybersecurity
and preparation for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2026.

## 🛠️ Tools

- **scan_headers.py** – Checks HTTP security headers and warns if critical headers are missing.
- **url_params_finder.py** – Extracts URL query parameters for IDOR, XSS, and logic-flaw testing.
- **zap_header_alerts.py** – Automates detection of missing security headers using OWASP ZAP API alerts.
