and preparation for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2026.

## 📂 Contents
- PDF write-ups of vulnerabilities
- Scripts and small tools for testing
- Notes from labs and practice (OWASP, PortSwigger, TryHackMe)

## 🎯 Focus Areas
- Web Penetration Testing
- OWASP Top 10 (XSS, SQLi, CSRF, IDOR, SSRF)
- Network basics & scanning
- Secure coding practices

## ⚖️ Ethics
All research here is done on labs, test environments,
or systems where I have permission. No illegal testing.
